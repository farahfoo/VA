Task was performed with references to [here](https://giniceseah.netlify.app/posts/2021-06-18-scraping-of-financial-dataset/#tidyquant-package)

# Task
* Script stock prices of top 40 companies in Singapore by market capitalisation between 1st January 2020 - 31st December 2021 by using tidyquant R package. [Link here](https://companiesmarketcap.com/singapore/largest-companies-in-singapore-by-market-cap/)
* For how to script historical stock price from Yahoo Finance by using tidyquant package, you can refer to this article.
* Using either calender heatmap or horizon graph, prepare a data visualisation showing the historical stock prices by the top 40 companies by market capitalisation.
* For horizon graph, you can refer to ggHoriPlot, a ggplot2 based R package specially designed for plotting horizon graph.
* For calender heatmap, you can refer to ggTimeSeries, a ggplot2 extension provides additional display mediums for time series visualisations.



# Installing and Launching R Packages

Use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

packages = c('Quandl','rvest','quantmod','tidyquant','rmarkdown','tidyr','tidyverse',
             'data.table','XML','xml2','httr','rmarkdown','knitr')
for (p in packages) {
  if(!require(p,character.only = T)){
    install.packages(p)
  }
  library(p,character.only = T)
}

```

The code read_html() will be used to query data from Yahoo Finance. We are also using html_node()/html_nodes() to locate the first node that matches that selector and then we would extract its contents as text using html_text().

# rvest package

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

symbol = 'AAPL'
url = paste0('https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/', symbol, '/financials?p=', symbol)
html_data = read_html(url) %>% html_node('body') %>% html_text()

```

rvest is a much general R packages where it allow scraping of data from any html webpage and not specific to only financial dataset. rvest library uses the technique of web scraping that enable us to parse the HTML content of a given URL and access the individual attribute that had been stored in the table on the page of the dataset.


# quantmod package

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

getSymbols ('AAPL', from="2015-01-01", to="2021-06-01")
head(AAPL)
AAPL =  last(AAPL,'1 year') 
head(AAPL)
AAPL =  first(AAPL,'1 year') 
```

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

stocklist=c("AAPL","GOOG")
getSymbols(stocklist)
hk=getSymbols("0941.HK",src="yahoo", auto.assign=FALSE)
head(hk)
```

Looking at volume data

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

Weekvol = apply.weekly(Vo(AAPL),sum)
head(Weekvol)

#Monthly trade volume

Mthvol = apply.monthly(Vo(AAPL),sum)
head(Mthvol)

#Yearly trade volume

Yearvol = apply.yearly(Vo(AAPL),sum)
head(Yearvol)

#Quarterly trade volume

Quartervol = apply.quarterly(Vo(AAPL),sum)
head(Quartervol)

# Weekly trade volume average 

Weekvol = apply.weekly(Vo(AAPL),mean)
head(Weekvol)
```


# tidyquant package

```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

from_date = "2015-01-01"
to_date = "2021-06-01"
period_type = "days"  # "days"/ "weeks"/ "months"/ "years"
stock_selected = "AAPL" 

stock_data_daily = tq_get(stock_selected,
               get = "stock.prices",
               from = from_date,
               to = to_date) %>%tq_transmute(select     = NULL, 
               mutate_fun = to.period, 
               period  = period_type)

paged_table(stock_data_daily)
```

In addition, benchmark indexes could be selected based on user requirements that help time series analysis to be performed much more effectively.


```{r echo = TRUE, message = FALSE}

from_date = "2015-01-01"
to_date = "2021-06-01"
period_type = "days"  # "days"/ "weeks"/ "months"/ "years"
benchmark_selected = "XLK" 

benchmark_data_daily = tq_get(benchmark_selected,
               get = "stock.prices",
               from = from_date,
               to = to_date) %>%tq_transmute(select  = NULL, 
               mutate_fun = to.period, 
               period  = period_type)

paged_table(stock_data_daily)
```

tq_get() is of similar function property as the quantmod R packages getSymbols() but the data query is returned in tibble format. To look into what are the other option available for tq_get(), we will be using tq_get_options() .

In the event when we need to query dataset from Yahoo Finance not restricted to stock price, we are able to make changes to the get argument within tq_get() to retrieve other key attributes such as ‘key.stats’,’dividends’,’stock.prices.japan’ etc. Also, using tq_exchange() we are able to retrieve all the names of the individual stocks that are within a given exchange.
