alt.atheism,54256,
alt.atheism,54256,	It depends on how he defines God. The way I understand the meaning
alt.atheism,54256,of that term preclues it being used in a useful way in science. Ideas drawn
alt.atheism,54256,from an understanding that God is supernatural precludes us from forming
alt.atheism,54256,"scientific assertions that can be falsified, that is, where we can decide"
alt.atheism,54256,that they are true or false within the terms of we use and useful observations
alt.atheism,54256,drawn from them.
alt.atheism,54256,
alt.atheism,54256,	Some religionists have an interest in bluring the definitions within
alt.atheism,54256,"science to make them more reconcilable, and especially subserviant in a basic"
alt.atheism,54256,"way, to religious dogma. This pursuit always fails."

alt.atheism,54256,>explanations of science or parts of theories that are not measurable in and of
alt.atheism,54256,">themselves, or can everything be quantified, measured, tested, etc.?  "
alt.atheism,54256,
alt.atheism,54256,	Reconciliation of science with religion involves circumventing the
alt.atheism,54256,"tendancy to claim that either pursuit can gain absolute or certian knowledge,"
alt.atheism,54256,or that the domain of truth in each is fundementally limited in some way. It
alt.atheism,54256,gererally confurs the element of uncertainty and limitations to human knowledge
alt.atheism,54256,while allowing for the different concerns of these separate pursuits. Science
alt.atheism,54256,and religion ask different questions which have imperfect and provisional
alt.atheism,54256,"answers, at best. Science is distinctly limited in where it can ask meaningful"
alt.atheism,54256,questions. More questions can be posed than it can answer. At the basis of
alt.atheism,54256,sacred language is the place where words fail us and mere assertions disolve
alt.atheism,54256,in contradiction.

alt.atheism,54468,obituary for the late atheist Dr. Albert Sabin. In an old interview
alt.atheism,54468,rebroadcast on public radio just after his death he told about a time
alt.atheism,54468,a few years before when he was stricken with a very serious illness.
alt.atheism,54468,He admitted to having cried out to God while critically ill and on a
alt.atheism,54468,respirator. As it turned out he recovered and lived several more years.
alt.atheism,54468,After his recovery he attributed this to early indoctrination. Don't say
alt.atheism,54468,"it couldn't happen to you, or that it hasn't happened to others, even if"
alt.atheism,54468,you are one of the few people who have experienced things like this.

comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,I have a 105MB IDE drive and am having a few problems! I get 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,'Data error on drive C' messages when reading some files. The problem is
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,also steadily getting worse.
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,I have run some diagnostic software (PCTools V7.1) and it says that the
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,drive is OK - but it does have to retry some sectors and it briefly 
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,flashes up an error message (which is too quick to read).
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,Does anybody know of any cheap or free software which could mark these
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,sectors as bad (DOS doesn't) or preferably perform a low level format.
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,I have heard that the latter is possible on an IDE. Technical answers
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware,61173,would be appreciated. It would be nice to be able to use the disk again!!!

comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,"I'm looking at an ad for the new 3.5"" FAST SCSI-2 drives from Micropolis"
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,"in the June, 1993, MacWorld. (I have seen similar ads for the IDE versions"
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,in IBM PC magazines)
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,"Well, the ad says that all three drives have a FAST SCSI-2 interface,"
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,"but then it says that the DTR rate for each drive is 5 megabytes/second,"
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,*max*.
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,How can this be?  I thought that if a drive was to be FAST SCSI-2 it
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,had to have a DTR of 10megs a second?
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,(I am assuming the 5megs/sec claim by Micropolis is from the 512k cache.
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,I admit that I would be very impressed if the drive can *read/write* data
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,at 5megs a second!)
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,
comp.sys.mac.hardware,52440,Thank you.

comp.sys.mac.hardware,52446,right?  I also notice the fan in my System Saver turning at different

comp.windows.x,68323,What are HyperHelp and Xprinter?  Read on......
comp.windows.x,68323,---------------------------------------------------------
comp.windows.x,68323,Bristol Technology is proud to announce version 3.0 of
comp.windows.x,68323,its popular HyperHelp product and version 2.0 of Xprinter.
comp.windows.x,68323,
comp.windows.x,68323,			    HyperHelp 3.0
comp.windows.x,68323,			    -------------
comp.windows.x,68323,HyperHelp is the de-facto standard for on-line context
comp.windows.x,68323,sensitive help in the Unix marketplace.  Through a one
comp.windows.x,68323,"line function call, application developers can access the"
comp.windows.x,68323,full features of HyperHelp and cut down drastically on
comp.windows.x,68323,"their development time.  HyperHelp can use the same RTF,"
comp.windows.x,68323,"project, and bitmap files as the MS Windows Help facility."
comp.windows.x,68323,This allows a documentation department to maintain a single
comp.windows.x,68323,"set of help documents portable between MS Windows, Motif and"
comp.windows.x,68323,Open Look.  HyperHelp can also be authored in FrameMaker. 
comp.windows.x,68323,And with HyperHelp 3.0 Bristol introduces its SGML compiler!
comp.windows.x,68323,
comp.windows.x,68323,"New features in HyperHelp 3.0 include secondary windows,a character"
comp.windows.x,68323,"based viewer, segmented bitmaps, SGML support, and an improved History"
comp.windows.x,68323,window.
comp.windows.x,68323,
comp.windows.x,68323,			     Xprinter 2.0
comp.windows.x,68323,			     ------------
comp.windows.x,68323,Xprinter 2.0 allows developers to add sophisticated
comp.windows.x,68323,printer support to their existing/new X based applications
comp.windows.x,68323,very easily.  Xprinter uses the Xlib API for both the
comp.windows.x,68323,display and printer.  This lets you use the exact same code
comp.windows.x,68323,for drawing and printing.  Take a look at the source code for
comp.windows.x,68323,our demo and see Xprinter in action.
comp.windows.x,68323,
comp.windows.x,68323,If you are interested in adding PostScript and PCL5 support
comp.windows.x,68323,"to your application, Xprinter is the tool for you!  Earlier"
comp.windows.x,68323,this year Bristola dn USL signed an agreement that
comp.windows.x,68323,resulted in Xprinter becoming the standard printing technology
comp.windows.x,68323,for UNIX SVR4.2.
comp.windows.x,68323,
comp.windows.x,68323,

comp.windows.x,68325,
comp.windows.x,68325,I am working for a company which has only one connection to the Internet.
comp.windows.x,68325,This is through a firewall gateway (unix workstation). I would like to be
comp.windows.x,68325,able to telnet to a host outside the company and set the DISPLAY to my PC
comp.windows.x,68325,which is running an X-terminal emulator (eXceed/W). The display can be set
comp.windows.x,68325,to the gateway workstation with no problem but when I set the variable to 
comp.windows.x,68325,"my IP address I get a ""Error: Can't open display"" message. "
comp.windows.x,68325,
comp.windows.x,68325,This can't be that hard to work around can it?
comp.windows.x,68325,
comp.windows.x,68325,BTW I have no trouble running x-clients on local workstations (in the company)
comp.windows.x,68325,and having them display on my PC.

rec.autos,103807,   I have an insurance question.
rec.autos,103807,
rec.autos,103807,Allstate insurance
rec.autos,103807,
rec.autos,103807,SITUATION: Person wrecks car. Car is drivable to dealer. Person 
rec.autos,103807,reports accident (no other cars involved). Driver estimates damage cost 
rec.autos,103807,"exceedes cost of car. Insurance people claim car is ""totalled"" because of "
rec.autos,103807,exceeding repair costs.
rec.autos,103807,"Person says ""WWHHHAATTTT!!!! But I drove the car here!"" and takes it to "
rec.autos,103807,"another place. Other place estimates 2,101.00 in damage. 2,000 less than the "
rec.autos,103807,dealer.
rec.autos,103807,One more hitch... The car is registered in Florida but the accident occurred 
rec.autos,103807,in Pennsyvania.
rec.autos,103807,
rec.autos,103807,"QUESTION: Should the insurance recognize and pay for the damages of this, "
rec.autos,103807,"now fixable, car even though they prematurly declared totalled?"
rec.autos,103807,
rec.autos,103807,Please respond via E-Mail if you think you know anything about this sort of 
rec.autos,103807,thing.

rec.sport.hockey,54897,Bautin and Ulanov. Mental lapses by the defence and goal-scoring talent
rec.sport.hockey,54897,in opportune areas made the difference in all three Canuck goals.

rec.sport.hockey,54897,checking hard and penetrating the Vancouver zone without being challenged

rec.sport.hockey,54897,	Domi's goal gave the Jets new life as they began to take the rush
rec.sport.hockey,54897,to the Canuck's collapsing defence. The Canucks were unwilling to do 
rec.sport.hockey,54897,anything but let McLean take shots and clear the rebounds. The Jets were
rec.sport.hockey,54897,allowed to set up and make plays.
rec.sport.hockey,54897,	Both goalies made standup saves as the play picked up considerably.
rec.sport.hockey,54897,McLean made three great saves in the second off a dancing Teammu Selanne
rec.sport.hockey,54897,while Essensa was rocked by a Pavel Bure drive. Selanne looked dangerous
rec.sport.hockey,54897,on the rush as the Jets pressed a series of attacks into the Canuck
rec.sport.hockey,54897,"zone. The Canucks, on the other hand, looked like they were offering four"
rec.sport.hockey,54897,checking lines in an effort to preserve their slim lead.
rec.sport.hockey,54897,	A series of minor penalties at the end of the second period
rec.sport.hockey,54897,resulted in a one man advantage for the Jets in the early third. The
rec.sport.hockey,54897,Jet's Tempo Numminen drove a puck from the point through McLean's
rec.sport.hockey,54897,legs and into the net to tie the game at 2-2.
rec.sport.hockey,54897,	The Canuck's discordant play picked up where it left off.
rec.sport.hockey,54897,This was characterized by long lead passes that either never connected
rec.sport.hockey,54897,or were picked off by the Jets and individual rushes into a tight
rec.sport.hockey,54897,Winnipeg defence that were never supported.
rec.sport.hockey,54897,"	However, as in the first and second Canuck goals, a Jet defensive"
rec.sport.hockey,54897,lapse (re: bonehead play) stalled the Winnipeg comeback. With the faceoff
rec.sport.hockey,54897,"in the Winnipeg zone, Pavel Bure was left to stand in the crease with"
rec.sport.hockey,54897,"no Jet defender anywhere near him. Bure, who had been invisible in the"
rec.sport.hockey,54897,"game up to that point, took a rebound and managed to roof it with a "
rec.sport.hockey,54897,backhand even though he was off balance. 
rec.sport.hockey,54897,	By then it was too late for the Jets to come back. Essensa made it
rec.sport.hockey,54897,to the bench with one minute to go but the extra attacker did nothing
rec.sport.hockey,54897,"for their attack. Canucks 3, Winnipeg 2."
rec.sport.hockey,54897,	Next game is Friday at Winnipeg with the Jets in the hole by two games.

sci.crypt,16358,Lines: 51
sci.crypt,16358,
sci.crypt,16358,   I can think of a couple of ways of guaranteeing authenticity in a one-time
sci.crypt,16358,"pad encrytped scheme, though I'm not sure how to prove that what kind of"
sci.crypt,16358,authenicity they provide.
sci.crypt,16358, 
sci.crypt,16358,   An obvious first-attempt might be to prepend a truly random (unpredictable
sci.crypt,16358,"for Eve) block to the message, and then calculate a CRC which included the"
sci.crypt,16358,random starting block and all of the message.  This could be encrypted after
sci.crypt,16358,"the message.  The problem is, I'm not sure it's impossible to come up with"
sci.crypt,16358,a message that will hash to the same CRC regardless of the random starting
sci.crypt,16358,"block.  (It intuitively seems like it ought to be hard, but I'm not *that*"
sci.crypt,16358,"sure....)  Clearly, a crypto-strength hash like MD5 or the SHA would be"
sci.crypt,16358,"stronger, but again, I'm not sure I'm comfortable claiming that it's"
sci.crypt,16358,unbreakable.
sci.crypt,16358, 
sci.crypt,16358,   A scheme to use up some of the pad bits to decide how many bits of 0's
sci.crypt,16358,"to include in the plaintext stream before going on wouldn't be too bad,"
sci.crypt,16358,either.  At the cost of increasing the speed with which you use up your
sci.crypt,16358,"pad, this could be used to give you arbitrarily low probability that your"
sci.crypt,16358,"opponent could spoof a valid-looking message, since any deciphered plaintext"
sci.crypt,16358,in a spot that should be carrying 0's will show that something funny's going
sci.crypt,16358,on.
sci.crypt,16358, 
sci.crypt,16358,"   If, for each message bit M_i, we used up one random bit, R_i, to decide"
sci.crypt,16358,"whether to insert a 0 into the plaintext stream, we'd get a total pad use"
sci.crypt,16358,of 2.5 times the message length.  (We'd expand the message size by about
sci.crypt,16358,half.)  Each 0 that should appear in the plaintext stream that doesn't is a
sci.crypt,16358,"guess for our would-be spoofer.  At each bit, she has to guess.  I'm trying"
sci.crypt,16358,to see how to quantify her chances of making it all the way through the
sci.crypt,16358,"spoofed message, but it gets a little complicated, because she can get un-"
sci.crypt,16358,"synched, and still happen to have a 0 in that place in the spoofed message."
sci.crypt,16358, 
sci.crypt,16358,"   Now, I can see a simple way of doing this that's got to be as secure"
sci.crypt,16358,"as a one-time pad, at a cost of using 4 times the message length in pad bits."
sci.crypt,16358, 
sci.crypt,16358,"   For each message bit, M_i, use one random bit, R_i, and xor them together"
sci.crypt,16358,"to get X_i.  Now, encrypt the three bits with the one-time pad.  The enemy"
sci.crypt,16358,"has no way of guessing what R_i is, so he/she can't guess what X_i is, either."
sci.crypt,16358,Any change she makes in the ciphertext stream will have to involve a guess
sci.crypt,16358,of what R_i was.  Is there any way to do this without using so many pad bits?
sci.crypt,16358, 
sci.crypt,16358,   Spoofing the message is equivalent to correctly guessing as many random
sci.crypt,16358,"bits as there are bits in the message.  Clearly, this makes spoofing messages"
sci.crypt,16358,just as hard if you know the whole message text as if you know none of it.
sci.crypt,16358,"In fact, it looks to me like this makes it just as hard to generate a spoofed"
sci.crypt,16358,"message with the ciphertext as without it, but I'm not entirely sure about"
sci.crypt,16358,that.
sci.crypt,16358, 
sci.crypt,16358,   Is there an easier way of doing this that's provably as secure as the

sci.crypt,16359,>false message which was substituted by Eve.
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"Firstly, an aside:"
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"I agree that the weakness exists, but I have a lot of trouble"
sci.crypt,16359,believing that it represents a difficulty in real life. Given:
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"1. the purpose of the one-time pad is to give unbreakable security,"
sci.crypt,16359,"and the expense of key distribution etc., imply that the clients"
sci.crypt,16359,really do want that level of security
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,2. These same people want to keep P a secret
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,I find it hard to believe that Eve might happen to have a copy of P
sci.crypt,16359,lying around.
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,(I am aware that the same argument applies to Eve knowing even a small
sci.crypt,16359,"part of the message, but Eve must know EXACTLY where (which bytes) in"
sci.crypt,16359,"C her known susequence starts, or the result will be garbled. I find"
sci.crypt,16359,this at least as surprising.)
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,Back to the question:
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"If I had the resources to use a one-time-pad for such transmissions, I"
sci.crypt,16359,"would also append a Message Authentication Code to the message, using up"
sci.crypt,16359,the next bits of the one-time-pad as the key perhaps. Your original
sci.crypt,16359,question basically asked whether there was any way to authenticate the
sci.crypt,16359,"message with the same degree of security as the Pad itself provided,"
sci.crypt,16359,"and I don't know the answer. However, I would propose the following"
sci.crypt,16359,for discussion.
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"Alice and Bob have an arbitrary number of secret, random bits to"
sci.crypt,16359,"share, which Eve doesn't know. She finds them out (effectively) by"
sci.crypt,16359,knowing some P and the corresponding C. It is the fact that they
sci.crypt,16359,CORRESPOND that causes the problem. If a message authentication code was to
sci.crypt,16359,be created using some one-time-pad operation such that Eve could not
sci.crypt,16359,"know which parts of the MAC were affected by which parts of the input,"
sci.crypt,16359,she would be unable to forge a MAC to correspond.
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,What is required is a non-linear combiner of parts of the message.
sci.crypt,16359,(Non-linear so that simply xoring or subtracting or whatever doesn't
sci.crypt,16359,have exactly the same effect).
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"Now, at the end of the encrypted message C, Alice appends a n-bit MAC"
sci.crypt,16359,computed as follows (S2 means the next full chunk of the one time pad):
sci.crypt,16359,"  1. compute C2 = P xor S2, and pad to an n-bit boundary with more of S"
sci.crypt,16359,  2. break C2 into n-bit chunks
sci.crypt,16359,  3. set MAC to 0 (initialisation vector)
sci.crypt,16359,  4. for i in each chunk sequentially
sci.crypt,16359,       set MAC = MAC NLOP C2[i]
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,At the end of this process MAC is the Message Authentication Code.
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,(Bob verifies the MAC in the obvious manner; he recovers the
sci.crypt,16359,"plaintext P, then uses some more of his pad to reproduce the MAC in"
sci.crypt,16359,the same manner.)
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"NLOP is the non-linear operator, and there is the rub. The simplest"
sci.crypt,16359,"non-linear operator I can think of is an S-box; that is, have a fixed"
sci.crypt,16359,"(even published) permutation of the n-bit integers, an indexable table"
sci.crypt,16359,"called Sbox, and use:"
sci.crypt,16359,  x NLOP y = x xor Sbox[y].
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"Practically speaking, I think this solves your problem, as Eve never"
sci.crypt,16359,"sees the intermediate output C2, and hence can't deduce S2 or perform any valid"
sci.crypt,16359,substitution on it.
sci.crypt,16359,
sci.crypt,16359,"Also practically speaking, you want the MAC to be fairly large, say 32"
sci.crypt,16359,"bits, but you might not want a 4 gigabyte (say) S-box, so you might"
sci.crypt,16359,"work on 4 byte-sized S-boxes, but I think that is an irrelevant detail"

sci.space,62478,Would Mr. Hart please explain how one could get every nation on
sci.space,62478,earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the
sci.space,62478,night sky without `coercion'.   Remember that not every nation
sci.space,62478,"follows the English common law.   In most countries, for most of"
sci.space,62478,"history, it was probably true that the rulers `owned' everything"
sci.space,62478,"not explicitly owned by individuals.   Even in North America,"
sci.space,62478,"where by the principle enunciated, the aboriginal inhabitants should"
sci.space,62478,"have owned everything, when new arrivals wanted to use land"
sci.space,62478,"and resources, they just took it over.  In case Mr. Hart hasn't noticed,"
sci.space,62478,there is currently a brutal war going on in Bosnia about who owns what.
sci.space,62478,"Of course, if some friendly super power were to give an international"
sci.space,62478,astronomy organization some anti-satelite missiles and also agree
sci.space,62478,"to defend it if attacked, such a proposal might work, but it"
sci.space,62478,would hardly be non-coercive.

sci.space,62479,The photos taken by the sats are stunning!  I know that sats are
sci.space,62479,capable of photographing the license plates of vehicles.  My
sci.space,62479,question is this:  The camp in question was taken out by the
sci.space,62479,"British SAS.  And while the SAS was in action, the CIA team was"
sci.space,62479,"watching in the warroom back in Langley, VA.  The action of the SAS"
sci.space,62479,was clear and appeared to be relayed via a sat.  The action was at
sci.space,62479,"night and the photography appeared to be an x-ray type.  That is,"
sci.space,62479,one could see the action within the tents/structures of the camp.

soc.religion.christian,21800,"of such a ""baptism"" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and"

soc.religion.christian,21805,[Let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a
soc.religion.christian,21805,"discussion of Islam, since there's a group for that.  But I suspect"
soc.religion.christian,21805,the point your teacher was making was not specifically about Islam.
soc.religion.christian,21805,Indeed it's going to be impossible to see what he was getting at
soc.religion.christian,21805,"within your groundrules, since the question of whether non-Christians"
soc.religion.christian,21805,are saved is at the heart of it.
soc.religion.christian,21805,
soc.religion.christian,21805,"The classic Christian view, which I think most people believed until"
soc.religion.christian,21805,"the last century or so, was that Christianity (and of course Judaism)"
soc.religion.christian,21805,"was the only religion founded by God, and that all other religions"
soc.religion.christian,21805,"worshipped false gods, and came from Satan.  This is more or less a"
soc.religion.christian,21805,corollary of another traditional view that no one but Christians (and
soc.religion.christian,21805,possibly Jews) will be saved.  This need not mean that there's no
soc.religion.christian,21805,"truth in any other religion, nor that all of their members are"
soc.religion.christian,21805,"intentionally Satanic.  After all, in order to be an effective snare,"
soc.religion.christian,21805,Satanic alternatives would have to be attractive.  Thus they might
soc.religion.christian,21805,"contain all kinds of truth, wisdom and spiritual insights.  They would"
soc.religion.christian,21805,be missing only one thing -- knowledge of salvation through Christ.
soc.religion.christian,21805,If this is the background of your teacher's remarks -- and I suspect
soc.religion.christian,21805,it is -- that means that a discussion of Islam is not necessarily
soc.religion.christian,21805,relevant.  The point is not that there's anything intrinsically wrong
soc.religion.christian,21805,"with it.  It may teach a fine code of behavior, and its practitioners"
soc.religion.christian,21805,may all be wonderful people.  But if salvation requires being a
soc.religion.christian,21805,"follower of Christ, it could still be a Satanic invention."
soc.religion.christian,21805,
soc.religion.christian,21805,This is a reasonable deduction from the classic Protestant position.
soc.religion.christian,21805,Christianity says that salvation isn't a matter of being kind and
soc.religion.christian,21805,"nice.  Those are good things, and we should encourage them.  But no"
soc.religion.christian,21805,one is able to do them enough to be saved.  Salvation requires Christ.
soc.religion.christian,21805,(Please forgive me for doing this in Protestant terms.  There's a
soc.religion.christian,21805,"Catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications, but in"
soc.religion.christian,21805,different terms.)  A religion may be quite attractive in all visible
soc.religion.christian,21805,"ways.  But if it doesn't have Christ, it's like a diet that consists"
soc.religion.christian,21805,"of food that looks wonderful, tastes great, but is missing some"
soc.religion.christian,21805,essential food element so that you end up dying.
soc.religion.christian,21805,
soc.religion.christian,21805,Let me be clear that I am not specifically advocating this position.
soc.religion.christian,21805,What I'm trying to do is (as usual) to clarify issues.  Indeed it is
soc.religion.christian,21805,now relatively uncommon for Christians to believe that all other
soc.religion.christian,21805,religions are Satanic.  Most Christians regard such beliefs as an
soc.religion.christian,21805,unfortunate vestige of the past.  This is part of a general move
soc.religion.christian,21805,within Christianity in the last century or so to a non-judgemental
soc.religion.christian,21805,God.  Christians now find it hard to believe that God would allow
soc.religion.christian,21805,"anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell, and they"
soc.religion.christian,21805,find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at
soc.religion.christian,21805,work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive
soc.religion.christian,21805,alternatives to Christianity.  Whether there is actually a sound basis
soc.religion.christian,21805,for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves.

soc.religion.christian,21808,"demands and were always accepting, no matter what the circumstances."
soc.religion.christian,21808,  What happened was that I grew up believing in situation ethics and
soc.religion.christian,21808,"never absolutes. I believed in a loving God, and my concept of God"
soc.religion.christian,21808,"never involved justice or punishment, nor was there any concept that"
soc.religion.christian,21808,I may someday be held responsible for the things that offended
soc.religion.christian,21808,"Him...sins that the ""world"" told me were OK."
soc.religion.christian,21808,"  My parents are very good, honest and moral people. They raised"

soc.religion.christian,21808,accepting unquestioningly everything we did without judgement or
soc.religion.christian,21808,counsel.
soc.religion.christian,21808,"  Today, it is absolutely appalling for me to look back on what they"
soc.religion.christian,21808,*did* accept without a word. It takes courages to dare to help souls
soc.religion.christian,21808,because you must speak up and say what is unpopular and

talk.religion.misc,84560,Lines: 110
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    In the King James Version of the Bible there are three differents words 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"translated into the word ""hell"".  These Greek words have totally different "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"meanings.  The words are Hades, Tartaros, and Gehenna."
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    In bibical usage, the Greek word Hades is used only 11 times in the "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"New Testament, and is roughly the equivalent to the Old Testament word Sheol..."
talk.religion.misc,84560,meaning the grave or pit (compare Acts 2:27 with Psalms 16:10).  Hades may be 
talk.religion.misc,84560,likened to a hole in the ground. (In the Bible it has nothing to do with fire!)
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    Most modern bibical translators admit that the use in the English word hell
talk.religion.misc,84560,to translate Hades and Sheol are an unfortunate and misleading practice.  
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    Why?  Because when seeing the word ""hell"" many readers impute to it the "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"traditional connotation of an ever-burning inferno, when this was never "
talk.religion.misc,84560,remotely intended in the Greek language or in Old English!
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    In its true bibical usage Hades does indeed refer to the state or abode of 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"the dead, but not in the sense of spirits walking around in some sort of "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"""shadowy realm.""  Hades is simply the abode we call the grave.  All dead go to "
talk.religion.misc,84560,this hell.
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    The second ""hell"" of the Bible, Tartaros, is mentioned only once in "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"scripture, 2 Pet.2:4; ""For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"them down to hell (TARTAROS), and delivered them into chains of darkness to be "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"reserved unto judgment..."""
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    Following their rebellion to unseat God from His throne (Isa.14:12-14; 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"Rev.12:4), the archangel Lucifer (now Satan) and a third of the created angels "
talk.religion.misc,84560,(now demons) were ejected from heaven (Luke 10:18).  They were cast down to 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"Tartaros, a place or condition of restraint that God has imposed on the "
talk.religion.misc,84560,mutinous angels as they await ultimate judgment (Jude 6; 1 Cor.6:3).
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    Tartaros, then, is a ""hell"" that applies only to evil, rebellious angels or"
talk.religion.misc,84560,demons (It is interesting that the ancient Greeks used this word to describe 
talk.religion.misc,84560,the place in which Zeus confined the rebellious Titans).  Nowhere in the Bible 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"is there any mention of men being put into this particular ""hell""."
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    The the third word that is translated as ""hell"" in the Bible is Gehenna. It"
talk.religion.misc,84560,"comes from the Hebrew GAI HINNOM, meaning ""valley of Hinniom.""  Hinnom is a "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"deep, narrow ravine located to the south and southwest of Jerusalem."
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    In Old Testament times it was a place of abominable pagan rites, including "
talk.religion.misc,84560,infant sacrifice (It was there that the apostate kings Ahaz and Manasseh made 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"their children ""pass through the fire"" to the god Molech.  The rites were "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"specifically celebrated in Tophet, the ""place of abhorrence,"" one of the chief "
talk.religion.misc,84560,groves in the valley).
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    King Josiah of ancient Judah finally put an end to these abominations.  He 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"defiled the valley, rendering it ceremonially unclean (2 Kings 23:10).  Later "
talk.religion.misc,84560,the valley became the cesspool and city dump of Jerusalem; a repository for 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"sewage, refuse and animal carcasses.  The bodies of dispised criminals were "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"also burned there along with the rubbish.  Fires burned continuously, feeding "
talk.religion.misc,84560,by a constant supply of garbage and refuse.
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    Aceldama, the ""field of blood"", purchased with the money Judas received for"
talk.religion.misc,84560,the betrayal of Christ (Matt.27:8) was also in part of the valley of Hinnom.
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    So what does this valley called Gehenna have to do with hell?  
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    In Rev.19:20: the Satan inspired political dictator and a miracle-working 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"religious figure, the False Prophet, working with him will resist the "
talk.religion.misc,84560,re-establishment of the government of God by Jesus Christ at His Second Coming.
talk.religion.misc,84560,"Their fate is revealed by the apostle John: ""And the beast was taken, and with "
talk.religion.misc,84560,him the false prophet...  These both were cast alive into a lake of fire 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"burning with brimstone."""
talk.religion.misc,84560,    
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    Where will this temporary lake of fire (this ""hell"") be?"
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    The prophet Isaiah wrote of this lake of fire prepared for the Beast: ""For "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"Tophet (in the valley of Hinnom) is ordained of old, yea for the king it is "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof is fire and wood, "
talk.religion.misc,84560,"the breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, doth kindle it"" (Isa.30:33)."
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    One thousand years later, Satan himself will be cast into this rekindled "
talk.religion.misc,84560,fiery lake where the Beast and False Prophet were cast! (Rev.20:10).
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    But what of the wicked who have died over the millennia?  Does the Bible 
talk.religion.misc,84560,say that they are now suffering fiery punishment for their sins in a lake of 
talk.religion.misc,84560,fire?
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,    In the sequence of Rev.20 the incorrigibly wicked are resurrected to be 
talk.religion.misc,84560,thrown into the lake of fire after Satan is cast there! (Rev.20:15). What will 
talk.religion.misc,84560,become of these wicked?  Will they writhe in flames for eternity? 
talk.religion.misc,84560, 
talk.religion.misc,84560,    The wicked will be burned up from the intense heat of the coming Gehenna 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"fire on the earth.  They wil be consumed, annihilated, destroyed!  This "
talk.religion.misc,84560,punishment will be everlasting (permanent and final).  The Bible calls it the 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"""second death"" (Rev.20:14; 21:8), from which there is no possibility of a "
talk.religion.misc,84560,further resurrection.
talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    The Bible does teach eternal punishment, but not eternal punishing."
talk.religion.misc,84560,                           
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    The prophet Malachi provides a graphic description. ""For, behold, the day "

talk.religion.misc,84560,"wickedly, shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up..."""
talk.religion.misc,84560,"(4:1).  To the righteous, God says that the wicked shall be ""ashes under the "

talk.religion.misc,84560,
talk.religion.misc,84560,"    Gehenna was a place of destruction and death, not a place of living "
talk.religion.misc,84560,torture!  Jesus was talking to Jews who understood all about this Gehenna or 
talk.religion.misc,84560,"valley of Hinnom.  Utter destruction by fire was complete.  Nothing was left, "
talk.religion.misc,84560,but ashes!
talk.religion.misc,84560, 
talk.religion.misc,84560,    Every text in the Bible translated from this Greek word Gehenna means

talk.religion.misc,84560,"Bible says, in Romans 6:23, ""The wages of sin is death"", not eternal life in "
