# Network Metrics

The network is built using the statistics, to determine the number of nodes, complexity, visual clustering, closeness of the nodes. 
Between-ness is referring to the importance of the node / concentration risk.

Close-ness means which node is the central that requires the least number of paths to travel from 1 end to the other.

# Examples of network

The centrality index is based on the number of flights from one airport to another airport.

* Bipartite graph - A graph of analysis of executives to reveal the connections between the board of directors

* Neo4j is a noSQL graph database, used to create graphical relational [database.](https://neo4j.com/developer/get-started/) 

* [tidygraph](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/introducing-tidygraph/) is a Tidy API for graph manipulation. 

# Organising the layouts of the network

* [Force-directed layouts](C:/farahfoo/VA/Pictures/force-directed layout.PNG) help to put the layout with equal distance. It is used when all members have the same characteristics. 
* Time layouts
* Radial hierarchical layout
* [Geographical layout](https://wiki.smu.edu.sg/1617t3isss608g1/ShinyNET_Data_Prep_Report)
* Tree hierarchical layout - used to map out file path directory
* [Sankey diagram](https://observablehq.com/@d3/sankey) - use to show industry products and different energy use in the UK. ![Sankey network by Prof Kam](C:/farahfoo/VA/Pictures/sankey.PNG)

# Customisation of parts of the visualisation to represent

Node size, Label, Shapes, Images, Border colour, Weight of line, line colour, line type all can be customised to value-add to the network visualisation.
